    <h1>Q: What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
    <h4>Ans: The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface which represents web pages in a tree structure to facilitate access and management of elements. When a webpage is    loaded, the browser will create a Document Object Model for the webpage. <br>
     Elements in an HTML document are organised similarly to objects for the same reason: A hierarchical structure aids computer programs in reading and processing data. In the case of HTML, the program is your web browser, and scripting languages such as JavaScript update and modify the HTML code. The DOM connects JavaScript to the original HTML code, allowing JavaScript to operate on specific HTML components. The interactive web design experience is created by the interplay of JavaScript and HTML.
     The DOM similarly gives JavaScript access to nearly every element in an HTML document, from the full page to a single line of text. <br>
     Many times as consumers interact with complex web sites, these calls are executed. The DOM is constantly used by JavaScript.

    <h1>Q: How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
    <h4>Ans: When website expands in size, it may become more difficult to grab the pieces want to change. Javascript has several strong methods for selecting the objects looking for, but it might be difficult to know which one to use. DOM selectors are used in JavaScript to select HTML components inside a document.
        <br>
    <h3>Name the DOM methods:</h3>
    <ul>getElementById()</ul>
    <ul>getElementsByClassName()</ul>
    <ul>getElementsByTagName()</ul>
    <ul>appendChild()</ul>
    <ul>removeChild()</ul>
    <ul>document.querySelectorALL()</ul>
    <ul>document.querySelector()</ul>

    <h1>Q: What is event bubble?</h1>
    <h4>Ans: Event bubbling is a method of propagating events in the HTML DOM. It refers to the sequence in which events in nested components are transmitted. The process by which an event generated within a nested set of HTML elements is collected by the innermost element and flows up the DOM tree hierarchy to its outermost element is known as event bubbling in JavaScript. As a result, when the event propagates across the different outer elements, the event listeners associated with them are activated in the same sequence. While creating a webpage or website with JavaScript, the notion of event bubbling is employed, in which event handlers are executed when one element is nested on top of another and is part of the same event. This is known as Event Bubbling. Event bubbling is therefore employed while providing event flow for a web page. When one element is nested in another element and both components have registered listeners for the same event, event bubbling occurs. Thus calling is conducted from the deepest element to its parents, encompassing all ancestors from top to bottom. <br> Some events have a default action that the browser does at the conclusion of the propagation. For example, clicking on a link element or a form submission button prompts the browser to travel to a new page or submit the form.</h4>

    <h1>Q: What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
    <h4>Ans: A callback function is a function that is supplied as an input to another function and then executed inside the outer function to perform some type of procedure or action. It allows us to impose an order of actions on our JavaScript code. JavaScript functions are objects. As a result, functions can accept other functions as inputs and be returned by other functions. A higher-order function is one that accepts another function as an input or returns another function as a result. A callback function is any function that receives an argument.
        <h3>How it works:</h3>
        
        <ul>Firstly, define the filter() function that accepts an array of numbers and returns a new array of the odd numbers.</ul>
        <ul>Secondly, create an array of integers that contains both odd and even numbers.</ul>
        <ul>Finally, call the filter() function to get the odd numbers out of the numbers array and output the result.</ul>
        callback functions are also used for event declarations in JavaScript.
